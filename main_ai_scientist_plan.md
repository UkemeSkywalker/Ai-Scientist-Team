# Hackathon Project Plan â€“ AI Scientist Team (Amazon Strands + Next.js)

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement
How can we build a multi-agent AI Scientist system that automates research, analysis, experimentation, and visualization using **Amazon Bedrock (Strands agents)** and a **Next.js frontend**?

---

## ðŸ”¹ High-Level Idea
We create an **AI Scientist Team** powered by Amazon Strands agents, each acting as a specialist (Researcher, Data Collector, Experimenter, Critic, and Visualizer).  
Each agent contributes step by step, with outputs shown to the user in the UI **before the next agent runs**, ensuring transparency and collaboration.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Agents & Responsibilities

1. **Research Agent**
   - Formulates hypotheses based on the userâ€™s query.  
   - Searches open-source datasets or relevant research via APIs.  
   - Writes findings into **Bedrock shared memory**.

2. **Data Agent**
   - Pulls datasets from open repositories (Kaggle, AWS Open Data, HuggingFace Datasets).  
   - Cleans, formats, and stores in **Amazon S3**.  
   - Updates shared context for next steps.

3. **Experiment Agent**
   - Runs analyses or small-scale simulations using **Amazon SageMaker**.  
   - Produces structured results (metrics, findings, comparisons).  
   - Stores results in memory for Critic Agent.

4. **Critic Agent**
   - Reviews outputs for accuracy, bias, and limitations.  
   - Flags missing data, errors, or weak correlations.  
   - Adds structured feedback into shared context.

5. **Visualization Agent**
   - Generates clear, insightful visualizations using **QuickSight or Plotly in Next.js**.  
   - Emphasizes:  
     - **Core Findings**  
     - **Supporting Visuals**  
     - **Confidence & Metrics**  
     - **Comparisons**  
     - **Limitations/Notes**  
   - Communicates results to the user in the Next.js UI.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Orchestration & Communication
- Agents are implemented as **Strands Agents** inside **Amazon Bedrock Agent Core**.  
- They **do not talk directly**. Instead:  
  - Each agent writes its output into **shared memory**.  
  - Bedrock reads this memory and decides the next agent to run.  
- Triggering flow:  
  **Research â†’ Data â†’ Experiment â†’ Critic â†’ Visualization**  
- If one step fails, Bedrock triggers fallback paths (e.g., request more input from user).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Role of Amazon Bedrock
Bedrock acts as the **orchestrator and conductor**:  
- Maintains **shared memory**.  
- Dynamically triggers the right agent or AWS service.  
- Ensures workflow is **coordinated, adaptive, and quality-controlled**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Frontend (UI):** Next.js + TailwindCSS  
- **AI Agents:** Amazon Bedrock (Strands Agents + Agent Core)  
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 (datasets, experiment results)  
- **Computation:** Amazon SageMaker (model training, analysis)  
- **Visualization:** Amazon QuickSight / Plotly.js inside Next.js  

---

## ðŸ”¹ User Flow
1. User enters a research question in the Next.js UI.  
2. Research Agent proposes a hypothesis â†’ displayed to user.  
3. Data Agent finds datasets â†’ displayed to user.  
4. Experiment Agent runs analysis â†’ displayed to user.  
5. Critic Agent evaluates results â†’ displayed to user.  
6. Visualization Agent produces final insights + charts.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Execution Steps

1. **Setup Infrastructure**
   - Provision AWS services (S3, SageMaker, Bedrock access).  
   - Configure Bedrock Strands Agents in Agent Core.  

2. **Develop Agents**
   - Implement Research, Data, Experiment, Critic, Visualization agents as Bedrock Strands workflows.  
   - Connect agents to shared memory context.  

3. **Integrate Services**
   - Data Agent â†’ Pull datasets â†’ S3.  
   - Experiment Agent â†’ Run models/analysis in SageMaker.  
   - Visualization Agent â†’ Generate charts with QuickSight/Plotly.  

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Build Next.js UI with step-by-step results view.  
   - Add Tailwind styling + chart embedding.  

5. **Testing & Demo**
   - Run a real-world query end-to-end.  
   - Ensure each agentâ€™s result is displayed before moving on.  
   - Record metrics (speed, accuracy, user clarity).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Deliverables
- Working **Next.js app** showing multi-step agent collaboration.  
- Live **AWS Bedrock orchestration demo** with Strands agents.  
- Clear **visualizations and insights**.  
- Architecture + Sequence diagram.

## ðŸ”¹ Architecture Summary
**User â†’ Next.js UI â†’ Bedrock Orchestration â†’ Agents (Research â†’ Data â†’ Experiment â†’ Critic â†’ Visualization) â†’ AWS Services (S3, SageMaker, QuickSight) â†’ Back to UI**
