# AI Scientist Team Product Overview

## Purpose
A multi-agent research system powered by Strands SDK that automates comprehensive research workflows through specialized AI agents. The system orchestrates five distinct Strands agents (Research, Data, Experiment, Critic, Visualization) to conduct end-to-end research analysis with advanced agent-to-agent collaboration.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Strands-Powered Research Pipeline**: Complete research workflow from hypothesis to visualization using production-ready agent framework
- **Transparent Agent Process**: Each Strands agent's output and tool execution is displayed with full conversation history
- **Advanced Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized Strands agents work together through context sharing and A2A communication
- **Real-time Agent Progress**: Live workflow status using Strands observability and streaming capabilities
- **Cloud-Agnostic Deployment**: Multi-cloud support through Strands tools abstraction

## Target Use Cases
- Academic research automation with agent collaboration
- Data science hypothesis testing using Strands agent workflows
- Literature review and analysis with A2A peer validation
- Experimental design and validation with agent-to-agent communication
- Research report generation with Strands visualization tools

## Key Features
- Web-based research query interface with Strands streaming integration
- Strands agent orchestration with agent-as-tools pattern
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication for peer collaboration and validation
- Strands context management for conversation history and state persistence
- Built-in observability and tracing through Strands SDK
- Cloud-agnostic tool integration for multi-provider deployment

## Current Status
Phase 1 complete with Next.js interface and Python foundation. Currently implementing Strands SDK integration with agent-as-tools orchestration and A2A communication capabilities.

## Development Resources
- **Strands SDK Documentation**: Use `search_docs` with serverName "strands-agents" for implementation guidance
- **Best Practices**: Reference Strands agent patterns and multi-agent orchestration examples
- **Community Tools**: Leverage strands-tools package for common functionality
