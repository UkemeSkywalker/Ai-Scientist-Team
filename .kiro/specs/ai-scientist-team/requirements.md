# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Scientist Team is a multi-agent system that automates research, analysis, experimentation, and visualization using Amazon Bedrock Strands agents (implemented in Python) orchestrated through Amazon Bedrock Agent Core. The system provides a transparent, step-by-step collaborative approach where each specialized agent contributes to solving research questions, with outputs displayed to users before the next agent executes. The frontend is built with Next.js to provide real-time visibility into the agent workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration System

4. WHEN shared memory is updated THEN Agent Core SHALL determine and trigger the next appropriate Python Strands agent in the sequence
5. IF a Python Strands agent fails to complete its task THEN Agent Core SHALL implement fallback mechanisms or request additional user input
6. WHEN the workflow completes THEN Agent Core SHALL provide a comprehensive summary of all Python Strands agent contributions

6. IF required datasets are not available THEN the Data Strands Agent SHALL suggest alternative data sources or synthetic data options

### Requirement 4: Experiment Execution Agent

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want an agent that can run analyses and simulations automatically, so that I can test hypotheses without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python-based Experiment Strands Agent is triggered THEN it SHALL run analyses or simulations using Amazon SageMaker Python SDK
2. WHEN experiments are designed THEN the Experiment Strands Agent SHALL use data from S3 and hypotheses from shared memory
3. WHEN experiments complete THEN the Experiment Strands Agent SHALL produce structured results including metrics, findings, and comparisons using Python scientific libraries
4. WHEN results are generated THEN the Experiment Strands Agent SHALL store results in shared memory for the Critic Agent
5. WHEN experiment results are ready THEN the system SHALL display experimental findings to the user before proceeding
6. IF experiments fail THEN the Experiment Strands Agent SHALL provide diagnostic information and suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 5: Quality Assurance and Validation Agent

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want an agent that critically evaluates results for accuracy and limitations, so that I can trust the findings and understand their constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python-based Critic Strands Agent is triggered THEN it SHALL review all previous agent outputs for accuracy, bias, and limitations
2. WHEN reviewing results THEN the Critic Strands Agent SHALL flag missing data, errors, or weak correlations using Python statistical analysis libraries
3. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the Critic Strands Agent SHALL add structured feedback into shared context
4. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL display the critical evaluation to the user
5. IF significant issues are found THEN the Critic Strands Agent SHALL recommend specific improvements or additional experiments
6. WHEN critical review completes THEN the Critic Strands Agent SHALL provide confidence scores for the overall findings

### Requirement 6: Visualization and Communication Agent

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want clear, insightful visualizations of research findings, so that I can understand and act on the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python-based Visualization Strands Agent is triggered THEN it SHALL generate visualizations using Python libraries (matplotlib, plotly) and integrate with Amazon QuickSight
2. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the Visualization Strands Agent SHALL emphasize core findings, supporting visuals, confidence metrics, comparisons, and limitations
3. WHEN visualizations are complete THEN the Visualization Strands Agent SHALL communicate results through the Next.js UI
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts and downloadable reports
5. IF visualization requirements are complex THEN the Visualization Strands Agent SHALL create multiple complementary visual representations using Python visualization libraries
6. WHEN final presentation is ready THEN the system SHALL allow users to export and share the complete research package

### Requirement 7: Next.js Frontend Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive web interface that shows me each agent's progress in real-time, so that I can understand and trust the research process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL provide a Next.js interface with TailwindCSS styling
2. WHEN a research query is submitted THEN the interface SHALL display a step-by-step progress view
3. WHEN each agent completes its work THEN the interface SHALL display that agent's results before the next agent starts
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the interface SHALL provide clear visual indicators of workflow progress
5. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the interface SHALL present a comprehensive dashboard with all findings
6. IF users want to modify the process THEN the interface SHALL allow intervention at any step

### Requirement 8: AWS Service Integration
